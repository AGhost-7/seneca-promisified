# Seneca Promisified
This is a wrapper which makes senecajs not hostile to promises. Also permits
you to access seneca context without having to use the `this` keyword (arrow
functions).

This is not an _extension_, its just a wrapper; you will be able to use
old seneca plugins without having to worry about what its going to
break.

## Promises
This libary uses `any-promise`. You will need to register the kind of promise
you want the it to use.
